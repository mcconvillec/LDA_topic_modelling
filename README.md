## Introduction

Topic modelling is a technique for assigning topics to a given document/corpus based on its component words. Topic modelling has several important real-world examples, for example the ability to quickly categorise free text documents has allowed companies to automate screening of customer calls and customer service functions, resulting in dramatic efficiency improvements.

In this example, we will step through the following:

1) Pre-processing of free text documents using tokenization, lemmatization and stop word removal
2) Noise smoothing by removing words that appear infrequently
3) Bag of Words tranformation to represent our corpus in terms of word frequencies
4) Latent Dirichlet Allocation to calculate document-topic and topic-word probability distributions
